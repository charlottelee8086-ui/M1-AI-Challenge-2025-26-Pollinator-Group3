    "\n",
    "Each data sample corresponds to a pollinator event.\n",
    "For each event, the task is to predict the correct pollinator class among a fixed set of species.\n",

    "This format is:\n",
    "- Lightweight\n",
    "- Easy to manipulate\n",
    "- Recommended for building a baseline\n",

    "### 2. Raw Data in HDF5 (.h5) Format\n",
    "The raw sensor data is stored in `.h5` files.\n",
